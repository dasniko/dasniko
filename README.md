# Hi there 👋

I'm Niko, a freelance software developer and trainer, mainly focused on Java and JavaScript projects.
Working for customers from (nearly) all industries.
Love to code and to dev-ops in and for the AWS ☁️  cloud.

One of my main focus and core area is development and consulting around Keycloak SSO 🔐  (no, I'm not involved in the product or Red Hat, but my kudos go to the whole team who does an awesome job!).

Check out my YouTube channel, where I put also a few videos on how to do things with Keycloak:

See also some of my Keycloak demo SPI implementations, which are always a good start to customize your own Keycloak server:
